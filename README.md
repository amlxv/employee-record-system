## Note

A symbolic link (or "symlink") is a file system feature that can be used to create a link to a specific file or folder. This feature is required for creating a symbolic link to the images folder for saving the employees picture. If the server does not support or block the symlink feature, you cannot upload and access the images from the website. Basically, this feature is allowed by the majority of servers provider out there except for "free tier" server usage.
